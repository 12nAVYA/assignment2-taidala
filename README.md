###### victoria Falls
victoria Falls (Lozi: Mosi-oa-Tunya, "The Smoke That Thunders"; Tonga: Shungu Namutitima, "Boiling Water") is a waterfall on the Zambezi River in southern Africa, which provides habitat for several unique species of plants and animals. It is located on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe and is one of the world's largest waterfalls, with a width of 1,708 m (5,604 ft).
David Livingstone, the Scottish missionary and explorer, is believed to have been the first European to view the falls on 16 November 1855, from what is now known as **Livingstone Island**, one of two land masses in the middle of the river, immediately upstream from the falls near the Zambian shore.<br> Livingstone named his sighting in honour of **Queen Victoria**, but the Sotho language name, Mosi-oa-Tunya—"The Smoke That Thunders"—continues in common usage. The World Heritage List officially recognises both names
